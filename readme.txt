== Description ==
This plugin is an extension for [WP SlimStat](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-slimstat/), my plugin for tracking hits, visitors,
pageviews and outbound clicks on your blog. I was asked if it was possible to show
some metrics inside a post or using a widget. I decided to write a separate plugin
to do this. This way only people who really need this feature, will have to add it
to their box, while others will continue enjoying a lightweight and fast statistics plugin. 

## Requirements
* WP SlimStat 2.4 or higher

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire folder and all the subfolders to your Wordpress plugins' folder
2. Activate it
3. This plugin doesn't have any admin panel, it just works out of the box
6. Show your appreciation! Tell your friends you are using WP SlimStat Shortcodes, write an article about it!
