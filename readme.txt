== Description ==
An extension for [WP SlimStat](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-slimstat/) to display your reports on pages and widgets

Share your analytics data with your visitors, in just a few easy steps. Take WP SlimStat to the next level: list the most visited posts,
or categories, or the most popular search terms, or the most recent ones. The sky (or your DB size) is the limit! Need to filter your report for
a specific browser? Check. Want to create a page with last year's most popular search terms from France? Check. All you
have to do is to add a shortcode to the page where you want the stats to be displayed, and... save.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a shortcode? =
A [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) is sort of a placeholder: a special string that will be replaced by dynamic content.

= What do shortcodes look like? =

[slimstat f='FUNC' w='WHAT_COLUMN' lf='FILTERS' s='SEP']

where

* `f` [required] is the criteria to be used (count results, get popular or recent items)
* `w` [required] defines what dataset you want to retrieve (browser, language, resource; here below you can find a complete list of columns)
* `lf` [optional] specifies what conditions to use while retrieving the data (browser equals Firefox, country equals China); if the value starts with `WHERE:`, the string that follows will be used *verbatim* in the SQL query
* `lc` [optional, default: WHAT_COLUMN] tells the plugin what data to return; it defaults to the column specified in `w`
* `s` [optional] sets the character or string used to "separate" each piece of information in a row (defaults to `<span class='slimstat-item-separator'>,</span>`)

= Frequently used codes =

* Pageviews Today: `[slimstat f='count' w='ip' lf='day equals today']`
* Unique Human Visitors Today: `[slimstat f='count' w='ip' lf='day equals today&&&visit_id is_greater_than 0']`
* Currently Online: `[slimstat f='count-all' w='ip' lf='WHERE:NOW() - dt < 300']`
* Count all pageviews from the beginning: `[slimstat f='count-all' w='*']`
* Popular pages (this month): `[slimstat f='popular' w='resource' lf='content_type equals post' lc='post_link,count']`
* Recent searches: `[slimstat f='recent' w='searchterms']`
* Most active visitors: `[slimstat f='popular' w='user' lc='user,count']`

= Available functions =

* `count` and `count-all` return a number
* `recent` and `popular` return a bulleted list of elements
* `custom`, used along with `WHERE` to run a custom SQL query - i.e. `lf='WHERE:SELECT * FROM wp_slim_stats t1...'`; it returns a list of elements

= Available keys (WHAT_COLUMN) =

* `browser`: user agent (Firefox, Chrome, ...)
* `content_type`: post, page, *custom-post-type*, attachment, singular, post_type_archive, tag, taxonomy, category, date, author, archive, search, feed, home; please refer to the [Conditional Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags) manual page for more information
* `country`: 2-letter code (us, ru, de, it, ...)
* `domain`: domain name of the referring page (i.e., www.google.com if a visitor came from Google)
* `language`: please refer to the [language culture names](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx) (first column) for more information
* `platform`: operating system; it accepts identifiers like win7, win98, macosx, ...; please refer to [this manual page](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php) for more information about these codes
* `referer`: complete URL of the referring page
* `searchterms`: search term used to find your website on a search engine
* `user`: visitor's name according to the cookie set by Wordpress after s/he left a comment

= How do I filter the data returned by your plugin? =

A filter consists of three elements: the key, the condition and the value. For example, if you want to display your 20 most popular posts visited by people coming from Italy,
your key is `country`, your condition is `equals` and your value is `it` (Country code for Italy). You can combine multiple keys/values to further narrow down your results.

= Available filters =

* all the keys listed above
* `author`: Wordpress author associated to that post/page when the resource was accessed
* `browser`: user agent (Firefox, Chrome, ...)
* `version`: user agent version (9.0, 11, ...)
* `category`: ID of the category/term associated to the resource, when available
* `css_version`: what CSS standard was supported by that browser (1, 2, 3 and other integer values)
* `colordepth`: visitor's screen's color depth (8, 16, 24, ...)
* `ip`: visitor's public IP address
* `other_ip`: visitor's private IP address, if available
* `resolution`: viewport width and height (1024x768, 800x600, ...)
* `resource`: URL accessed on your site
* `type`: (browser) 1 = search engine crawler, 2 = mobile device, 3 = syndication reader, 0 = all others
* `direction`: asc or desc (lowercase)
* `limit_results`: max number of results returned
* `starting`: return results starting from a given offset

= Can I use date ranges? =
Yes you can! By default shortcodes return data related to the current month, but you can specify a different start date and the interval in your filters (along with the `equals` operator):

* `day` (default: 1)
* `month` (default: current month)
* `year` (default: current year)
* `strtotime`, use it if you want the plugin to use PHP's [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) function to calculate a specific date for you (yesteday, this month, last year, 3 weeks ago)
* `interval`, to fix the number of days from the start date (for example, ten days starting from January 14th); please make sure to define `interval` *after* the start date!
 * if both `day` or `strtotime` are set, the default value is zero
 * if neither `day` nor `strtotime` are set, the default value is the number of days in the current month
 * you can use `-1` to indicate the number of days between the start date and today (in other words, to describe date ranges like 'Year to date', you can set `day equals 1,month equals 1,interval equals -1`)

You can use natural language for day, month and year: day equals today, year equals last year, etc. The plugin will try to apply strtotime (see link here above) to your value.

= What conditional operators are available? (note: words are separated by underscores, not blank spaces!) =

* `equals`
* `is_not_equal_to`
* `contains`
* `does_not_contain`
* `starts_with`
* `ends_with`
* `sounds_like`
* `is_greater_than`
* `is_less_than`
* `is_empty` (followed by a blank space and the # sign: searchterms is_empty #&&&month equals 5)
* `is_not_empty` (followed by a blank space and the # sign: searchterms is_not_empty #&&&browser contains fire)

= How do I combine keys and values to create filters? =
In order to simplify things, WP SlimStat Shortcodes implements a 'natural language' approach. For example, let's say you want to obtain your blog's 5 most popular posts. This is what the shortcode will look like:

`[slimstat f='popular' w='resource' lf='content_type equals post&&&limit_results equals 5' lc='post_link,count']`

Curious about what your visitors where searching for, before landing on your blog?

`[slimstat f='recent' w='searchterms']`

Do you want to target a specific language? What about listing the 20 most recent Chinese-speaking IP addresses who accessed just your homepage:

`[slimstat f='recent' w='ip' lf='content_type equals home&&&language equals zh-cn&&&limit_results equals 20']`

Do you need just to count how many pageviews have been generated during the current month? (by default all shortcodes use the current month as date range)

`[slimstat f='count' w='*']`

Maybe this year?

`[slimstat f='count' w='*' lf='strtotime equals 1 January&&&interval equals -1']`

The first 5 days of January?
 
`[slimstat f='count' w='*' lf='day equals 1&&&month equals 1&&&interval equals 5']`

From the beginning (all pageviews recorded so far)

`[slimstat f='count-all' w='*']`

Unique IPs (unique visitors):

`[slimstat f='count' w='ip']`

Unique Visits this month:

`[slimstat f='count' w='visit_id']`

Things can easily get fancy

* `[slimstat f='popular' w='searchterms' lf='searchterms contains pizza dough' lc='searchterms,count']`

= Available columns (lc) =

* all the keys listed here above, separated by commas
* `count`, available only when using `popular`, represents the number of pageviews matching your query
* `dt`, combined with `recent`, can be used to display date and time of each pageview (it uses your Wordpress settings for date and time format)
* `hostname`, to convert IP addresses into hostnames, using PHP's [gethostbyaddr](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gethostbyaddr.php)
* `post_link`, returns post titles linked to their corresponding permalinks
